        Payment > 

        BACS Transfer are the main acceptable methods of payment. Our Terms are payment in full once the job is completed. When applicable, if material need to be bought the client can buy it directly or we can do it in its behalf if they send us the necessary money in advance. Payment for services should be made prior to inspection or service to confirm booking. If not, booking will be set as ”provisional” and can be cancelled or rescheduled at any time until payment is made to confirm booking slot. Monies that remain outstanding by the due date will incur late payment interest at the rate of 2% above the prevailing Bank of England’s base rate on the outstanding balance until such time as the balance is paid in full and final settlement. We reserve the right to seek recovery of any monies remaining unpaid sixty days from the date of invoice via collection Agencies and/or through the Small Claims Court in the event that the outstanding balance does not exceed £30. In such circumstances, you shall be liable for any and all additional administrative and/or court costs.
        Returned cheques will incur a £35 charge to cover banking fees and administrative costs. In an instance of a second Returned cheque, we reserve the right to terminate the arrangement and, if agreed to, we shall insist on future cash transactions only. Consequently, all bookings and/or transactions and agreements entered into will cease with immediate effect until such time as any and all outstanding monies are recovered in full.

        Call Out and Hourly Rates > 

        Our standard call out charge for one of our engineers to visit your property is £45. For instance if you want our engineer to come on site to check your gas installation so that we can give you an exact quote, then our engineer will come to draft the quote at a rate of £45. However we generaly ask for as much information, photo to know exactly what needs to be done. If a fixed price cannot be given for a job then we will charge an hourly rate of £75 after the first hour - the first being charged £150, this excludes any parts. If an engineer is called but you disagree and decide not to go ahead with work then the standard call out charge will still apply and have to be paid for on the day.

        Time allocation for jobs > 

        We aim to be as flexible to find a time slot that suits you. Because of uncertainty linked to the essence of this job we cannot ensure an exact time for the appointment. We generally go tell you what is our aim and when this should happen eg. Morning from 9am or around lunch, or evening. Please bear in mind that our engineer may emergencies on previous job and that traffic in the UK and specifically in London is not foreseable 100%. We will attempt to contact you to try and re-schedule another appointment as soon as possible at a mutually convenient time. If you wish to have a meeting on a very short timeline we will charge an extra £20. 

        Cancellation Policy & Missed Appointment > 
        If you are unable to keep a service appointment please contact us to re-book the appointment on 0800 999 8264 as soon as possible.
        Minimum twenty-four hours notice of cancellation required. Notification for instance, in person, via email, mobile phone ‘text message’ , or any other means will be accepted subject to confirmation in writing. We reserve the right to levy a £35 charge to cover any subsequent administrative expenses.
        Non attendance or call out will be charged, where the engineer cannot gain access to property, boiler is not working, no gas or electrical supply or no access to gas meter – when onsite and will incur a £30.00 per administrative charge.
        Please note that all terms in this contract apply to any third party you instruct to be at a premises on your behalf e.g. if you have a tenant that will be giving us access to the property the same terms apply.
